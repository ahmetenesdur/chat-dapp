# Sample Hardhat Project

This is a Solidity smart contract for a chat application on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract defines structs for users, friends, and messages, as well as mappings to store user and message data. The contract includes functions for creating and checking for user accounts, adding friends, sending and reading messages, and retrieving friend lists. It also includes internal helper functions for adding friends and generating a unique "chat code" for message threads between two users. Overall, this contract allows for secure and decentralized communication between users on the Ethereum blockchain.
