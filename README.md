# BNB Chain Development Bootcamp Final Case: Chat dApp

Welcome to the Chat dApp! This Solidity smart contract powers a chat application on the Binance Smart Chain. The contract defines structures for users, friends, and messages, along with mappings to efficiently store user and message data. The contract's functionalities encompass creating and verifying user accounts, adding friends, sending and reading messages, and fetching friend lists. Internal helper functions are in place for friend addition and generating unique "chat codes" for seamless message exchanges between users. The contract stands as a cornerstone for secure and decentralized communication on the Binance Smart Chain.

Enabling users to interact seamlessly with the smart contract, the dapp features a user-friendly interface. This interface empowers users to create accounts, add friends, exchange messages, review conversation histories, and access the contract's underlying state variablesâ€”such as user and message mappings. The dapp is skillfully crafted using a combination of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Solidity, Hardhat, and Ether.js.
